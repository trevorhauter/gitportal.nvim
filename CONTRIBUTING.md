# Contributing to gitportal

We really appreciate any and all contributions! If you're looking for something to work on, check the issues for this project. If you are looking to fix a bug that doesn't have a corresponding issue, it's OK to open a pull request directly. For new features, it is preferred to open an enhancement issue *before* beginning work so we can discuss it prior to implementation.

## Pull requests (PRs)
1. Update the `README.md` with any additions or changes to existing functionality.
1. Add new test coverage where possible
1. If you are unsure how to add test coverage, or are having any trouble at all, contact @trevorhauter
